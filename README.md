# P5R-Unhardcoded-Toolkit

This mod is a collection of patches that unhardcode many aspects of P5R. My bad documentation of the new game files and even some already existing game files can be found here:  https://secrec.gitbook.io/unhardcoded-stuff-lmao/

## THIS DOES NOT WORK ON THE GAMEPASS VERSION OF P5R
